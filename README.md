1. Creating a mental picture of what the website is supposed to do ie.
##### (a) Calculate day of birth using the following formula: 
##### Day of the week (d) = ( ( (CC/4) -2*CC-1) + ((5*YY/4) ) + ((26*(MM+1)/10)) + DD ) mod 7

 where;

 CC - is the century digits. For example 1989 has CC = 19

 YY - is the Year digits (1989 has YY = 89)

 MM -  is the Month

 DD - is the Day of the month 

 mod - is the modulus function ( % )
 ##### (b) Output the Akan name as follows: 
 ##### For males: Kwasi-Sunday is your day of birth, Kwadwo-Monday is your day of birth, Kwabena-Tuesday is your day of birth, Kwaku-Wednesday is your day of birth, Yaw-Thursday is your day of birth, Kofi-Friday is your day of birth, Kwame-Saturday is your day of birth.
